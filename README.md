# capgemini-pre-interview-test
Pre-interview Exercise for Developer Candidates
The following exercise will assess your ability to deliver well structured and maintainable
code. As a TDD shop we will put equal emphasis on evaluating your tests as we will on
the code itself. The exercise should only take 30 40
minutes; don’t spend much longer
than this.
Please complete the following exercise in either Scala or Java. If this exercise goes well,
you may be asked to make further amendments to your code during a pair programming
exercise with a member of the team. Please pick the language you think you will be best
able to demonstrate your skill and experience.
Please use git to version control your exercise. After completing the first step, please
clearly tag the commit so that we can evaluate your approach. You may make other
commits to further demonstrate your approach. Please compress your answers and
submit them via your agent or send us a link to your Github (or similar) account. Do not
send us binaries, they won’t get through our firewalls.
